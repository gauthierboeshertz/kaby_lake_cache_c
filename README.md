# Intel Kaby Lake Cache Memory Simulation

## Introduction
This repository hosts my work on a cache memory simulation for an Intel Kaby Lake processor, a comprehensive project I undertook at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) during my CS207-a system programming course in 2019. The simulation is developed in C and models the intricacies of a memory hierarchy as found in modern CPU architectures.

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a simulation that accurately represents the behavior of a 64-bit Intel processor's memory hierarchy. It aimed to provide insights into virtual-to-physical address translation, TLB functionality, and multi-tiered cache operations, all core components of a processor's memory management system. For a more comprehensive explanation of the project, please refer to the included `Description.pdf` document, which offers an in-depth description in French.

## Features
- Detailed 48-bit virtual address space simulation in line with Intel processor standards.
- Two-level hierarchical TLB and cache system emulation for instructions and data retrieval.
- Cache associativity and memory mapping strategies, incorporating Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policy.
- A comprehensive suite of tests designed to validate each memory management component and the overall system integrity.
